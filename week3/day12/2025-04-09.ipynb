    "The primary objective for normalizing the relations is to eliminate the below anomalies. Failure to reduce anomalies results in data redundancy, which may threaten data integrity and cause additional issues as the database increases. Normalization consists of a set of procedures that assist you in developing an effective database structure.\n",
    "* *Insertion Anomalies*: Insertion anomalies occur when it is not possible to insert data into a database because the required fields are missing or because the data is incomplete.\n",
    "    * E.g. if a database requires that every record has a primary key, but no value is provided for a particular record, it cannot be inserted into the database.\n",
    "* *Deletion anomalies*: Deletion anomalies occur when deleting a record from a database and can result in the unintentional loss of data.\n",
    "    * E.g. if a database contains information about customers and orders, deleting a customer record may also delete all the orders associated with that customer.\n",
    "* *Updation anomalies*: Updation anomalies occur when modifying data in a database and can result in inconsistencies or errors. \n",
    "    * E.g. if a database contains information about employees and their salaries, updating an employeeâ€™s salary in one record but not in all related records could lead to incorrect calculations and reporting."
