    "     - A description of the dataset: Mention that this dataset contains information about the highest-grossing concerts by female artists, including details like the artist's name, tour title, gross revenue (both actual and adjusted for 2022 dollars), the number of shows, and the average gross per show.\n",
    "     - 3-5 key questions or hypotheses you want to explore. Examples might include:\n",
    "       1. Which female artist has the highest grossing tours?\n",
    "       2. How does the adjusted gross compare across different tours?\n",
    "       3. Are there any patterns in the average gross per show across different artists?\n",
    "       4. Do artists with more shows tend to have higher overall gross revenue?\n",
